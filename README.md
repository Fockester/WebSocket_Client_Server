The objective of this project is to create a simple WebSocket to establish a connection between a Server and a Client.

It's a console application where the client can access the server's information about theaters.
The information can be given by the specification of the client's location or just searching all the theaters that the server
as stored in it's "database", which is a simple .csv file.

All the information of what theaters the client accessed, visualized and bought are stored in a .txt file.
Furthermore, the server can handle multiple connections.

The IP address requested by the Client is your own, get it from the console using *ipconfig*.


Im sorry for the portuguese comments I'll be translating those as soon as I can!
